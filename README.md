Tomboy-library

![travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/tomboy-notes/tomboy-library.svg?branch=master)

Several in the Tomboy community decided to write a core library
for tomboy. The library should allow others to interact with notes
easily for all platforms.

We are looking forward to suggestions and comments while developing
this library.

See the included unit tests for code examples.

Building
====

Checkout the repository from git on a Mac OS X or Linux machine and run `make`.
If you are on Windows, take a look at the `Makefile` and perform the build steps
manually of from within Visual Studio.
